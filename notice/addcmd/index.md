# -add Command Notice
The -add command has been moved to -play and no longer functions. The command will be completely removed in v2.0.9.

## Why name it -add in the first place?
The command was named -add because the original intention was to add to the queue and let the -join function do the rest. 
This did not go though and the -add command functioned as adding the song and playing it if there is nothing playing.

## Why move it to -play?
It makes more sense name wise. Also, people may get confused and use -play instead of -add. This results in an error saying that
the command does not exist.

## Why not keep -add and have -play at the same time?
While this is definitely possible and an option I have considered, it would be time consuming to have to update both commands when one is changed.
It would be much better to just move it to -play instead.
